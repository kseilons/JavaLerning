https://docs.oracle.com/error-help/db/ora-00980/00980. 00000 -  "synonym translation is no longer valid"
*Cause:    A synonym did not translate to a legal target object. This
           could happen for one of the following reasons:
           1. The target schema does not exist.
           2. The target object does not exist.
           3. The synonym specifies an incorrect database link.
           4. The synonym is not versioned but specifies a versioned
           target object.
*Action:   Change the synonym definition so that the synonym points at
           a legal target object.
